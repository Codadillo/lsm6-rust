# lsmd6-rust
This is a library for interacting over i2c with the LSM6DS33 gyroscope and acclerometer. It is based on the [manufacterer's aruduino specific library](https://github.com/pololu/lsm6-arduino) and the [datasheet](https://www.pololu.com/file/0J1088/LSM6DS33-AN4682.pdf). The methods that this library provide are abstracted away from a specific i2c implementation using traits from the [i2c crate](https://crates.io/crates/i2c).
